poweredgec deb maker
====================

Make hacky deb packages out of some of the tools on poweredgec.com.
Ok. So punish me.

I bear no responsibility for these packages, nor to poweredgec.com.

Also: this is basically a copy of this:

  http://askubuntu.com/questions/27715/create-a-deb-package-from-scripts-or-binaries

Set DEBEMAIL and DEBFULLNAME to something real. 

And yes: I realise that this is probably a bad thing. I don't really care.
I am not going to use this for anything. And neither is you.
